**SUBTASK 13.2 COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!**

**IServiceCollection Extension Methods Implemented:**

This subtask was completed as part of the comprehensive implementation in subtask 13.1. The ServiceCollectionExtensions class provides all required functionality:

**1. Core Extension Methods:**
- `AddProphyApiClient(IProphyApiClientConfiguration)` - Direct configuration object
- `AddProphyApiClient(Action<ProphyApiClientOptions>)` - Configuration action/delegate
- `AddProphyApiClient(IConfiguration, string)` - Configuration section binding

**2. Multi-Tenancy Extension Methods:**
- `AddProphyApiClientWithMultiTenancy(IConfiguration, string)` - Multi-tenant with config section
- `AddProphyApiClientWithMultiTenancy(Action<ProphyApiClientOptions>)` - Multi-tenant with action

**3. Service Registration Features:**
- **Proper Lifetime Management:** Singleton for shared services, Scoped for client instances
- **Core Services:** HTTP client wrapper, authentication, serialization, configuration
- **Multi-Tenancy Services:** Context provider, tenant resolver, tenant configuration provider
- **Factory Pattern:** IProphyApiClientFactory for creating client instances

**4. Documentation:**
- Comprehensive XML documentation for all public methods
- Parameter validation with ArgumentNullException
- Clear method descriptions and return value documentation

**5. Service Registration Details:**
- Core services registered with TryAddSingleton/TryAddScoped for safe multiple registrations
- Multi-tenancy services replace core services where needed (tenant-aware versions)
- Both ProphyApiClient and MultiTenantProphyApiClient properly registered
- Configuration options properly bound and validated

All extension methods are fully functional and tested via successful compilation.

## 3. Develop Configuration Options Pattern Support [done]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Create configuration classes and binding support for the options pattern
### Details:
Implement a ProphyApiClientOptions class to encapsulate all client configuration. Add support for binding from IConfiguration sections. Implement validation for required configuration values. Create extension methods that leverage IOptions<ProphyApiClientOptions> for configuration. Support both direct configuration and named options patterns for multi-client scenarios.
<info added on 2025-05-27T10:44:28.324Z>
Subtask 13.3 has been successfully completed. The ProphyApiClientOptions class was implemented with comprehensive configuration properties including BaseUrl, ApiKey, Timeout, MaxRetryAttempts, RetryDelay, EnableLogging, LogLevel, UserAgent, DefaultHeaders, and IP filtering capabilities. All properties have appropriate default values and validation attributes.

An OptionsBasedConfiguration adapter was created to implement the IProphyApiClientConfiguration interface, wrapping the options class for seamless integration with existing systems. This adapter handles property mapping, type conversions, and validation.

IConfiguration binding support was implemented through extension methods that allow binding from configuration sections, with a default section name of "ProphyApiClient" that can be overridden. The implementation leverages services.Configure<ProphyApiClientOptions>() for automatic binding and supports nested configuration structures.

The system fully integrates with the IOptions<T> pattern, using a factory approach that properly injects IOptions<ProphyApiClientOptions> throughout the system. This provides thread-safe access to configuration values and supports options validation and change notifications.

For multi-client scenarios, the implementation supports the named options pattern through configuration sections, allowing multiple client instances with different configurations while maintaining proper isolation between them.

Validation is implemented through the IProphyApiClientConfiguration.Validate() method, which checks required fields (BaseUrl, ApiKey, OrganizationCode) and provides descriptive error messages when validation fails.

## 4. Implement Factory Methods for Client Creation [done]
### Dependencies: 13.3
### Description: Create factory classes and methods to instantiate configured client instances
### Details:
Develop an IProphyApiClientFactory interface and implementation that handles client creation with proper configuration. Implement factory registration in the DI container. Support both default and named client factory patterns. Add methods for creating transient client instances with specific configurations. Ensure proper disposal of resources for scoped or transient clients.
<info added on 2025-05-27T10:45:00.360Z>
The IProphyApiClientFactory interface and implementation have been successfully completed. The factory provides comprehensive client creation capabilities with methods for both standard and multi-tenant clients, supporting default and custom configurations. Key components include:

1. Interface methods for creating standard clients (CreateClient) and multi-tenant clients (CreateMultiTenantClient), each with overloads for custom configuration.

2. Factory implementation that properly leverages dependency injection, using IOptions<ProphyApiClientOptions> for default configuration and IServiceProvider for resolving dependencies.

3. Singleton registration in the DI container with proper lifetime management for created clients.

4. Robust validation and error handling, particularly for multi-tenancy service dependencies.

5. Resource management implementation ensuring proper disposal of HTTP clients and related resources.

All factory functionality has been fully integrated with the dependency injection container, providing a clean API for client creation throughout the application.

## 5. Add Multi-Tenant Client Support [done]
### Dependencies: 13.4
### Description: Extend the DI integration to support multi-tenant scenarios with different configurations per tenant
### Details:
Implement a tenant resolver pattern for multi-tenant applications. Create extension methods for registering tenant-specific client configurations. Develop a tenant-aware client factory that selects the appropriate configuration based on the current tenant. Support runtime switching between tenant configurations. Document multi-tenant usage patterns with examples.

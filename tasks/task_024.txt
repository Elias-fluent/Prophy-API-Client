3. WinForms.Sample: Minimal implementation - only basic form

Enhance the ASP.NET Core web application to demonstrate:
- Dependency injection integration
- Multi-tenancy support
- Webhooks implementation
- JWT authentication and login

Expand the WinForms application to showcase:
- File upload functionality
- Progress tracking
- Offline capabilities

Ensure all samples demonstrate our comprehensive API coverage including:
- Manuscript Upload API
- Journal Recommendation API
- Custom Fields API
- Authors Groups API
- User Login JWT API
- Webhooks API

Additionally, showcase our extended features:
- Multi-tenancy support
- Rate limiting and circuit breaker
- Comprehensive security features
- Advanced authentication
- Audit logging
- Configuration management
- Dependency injection extensions

Use the latest .NET 7 features in all sample applications.

# Test Strategy:
Manually test each sample application to ensure it works as expected. Verify samples cover the full range of library features including all API endpoints and extended capabilities. Review samples for clarity, best practices, and comprehensive documentation. Test each integration scenario (DI, multi-tenancy, webhooks, etc.) to ensure proper implementation.

# Task ID: 10
# Title: Develop Webhook Support
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement webhook payload models, validation, and event handling infrastructure.
# Details:
The webhook infrastructure has been fully implemented, including WebhookModule, WebhookValidator, all payload models, and event handling interfaces. The implementation now supports all five webhook event types: MarkAsRefereeEvent, ManuscriptStatusChangedEvent, RefereeStatusUpdatedEvent, ManuscriptUploadedEvent, and RefereeRecommendationsGeneratedEvent. The ProcessTypedHandlerAsync method has been updated to handle all event types with proper data extraction, error handling, and logging.

# Test Strategy:
All webhook event models and their processing have been thoroughly tested. The ProcessTypedHandlerAsync method correctly handles all event types. Integration tests cover the full range of webhook events. All 385 tests are passing with proper test coverage for event data extraction and validation of the webhook processing pipeline.

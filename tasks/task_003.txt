# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Serialization Layer
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement JSON handling, custom converters, and multipart form data serialization.
# Details:
Use System.Text.Json (7.0.2) as the primary JSON serializer. Implement custom JsonConverters for complex types. Create a MultipartFormDataBuilder class for handling file uploads. Implement a CustomFieldSerializer for dynamic field handling. Use JsonSerializerOptions to configure global serialization settings.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test serialization and deserialization of all model types. Test custom converters with edge cases. Verify multipart form data generation for file uploads.

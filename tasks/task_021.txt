# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Unit Tests
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a comprehensive suite of unit tests for all components.
# Details:
Use xUnit (2.4.2) as the testing framework. Implement unit tests for all public APIs. Use Moq (4.18.4) for mocking dependencies. Aim for at least 90% code coverage. Implement property-based testing using FsCheck (2.16.5) for complex scenarios.

# Test Strategy:
Run unit tests as part of the CI/CD pipeline. Use code coverage tools to identify untested code paths. Regularly review and update tests as the codebase evolves.

# Task ID: 16
# Title: Develop Multi-Tenancy Support
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 2, 6, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement multi-tenant architecture with organization isolation.
# Details:
Create an OrganizationContext class for managing tenant-specific data. Implement middleware for automatic tenant resolution. Develop isolation strategies for API keys and configurations. Use AsyncLocal<T> for maintaining tenant context across async operations.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test tenant isolation in multi-threaded scenarios. Verify correct tenant resolution from various sources. Test integration with authentication and configuration systems.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design OrganizationContext Class [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create an OrganizationContext class to encapsulate and manage tenant-specific data and context throughout the application lifecycle.
### Details:
Define the structure and responsibilities of the OrganizationContext class, ensuring it can store and retrieve tenant-specific information such as organization codes, configuration, and user context.

Successfully implemented the OrganizationContext class and IOrganizationContextProvider interface:

✅ **OrganizationContext Class Created:**
- Immutable design using System.Collections.Immutable
- Stores organization code, name, API key, base URL, custom properties, and user claims
- Provides fluent API methods (WithApiKey, WithBaseUrl, WithProperties, WithUserClaims)
- Implements proper equality comparison based on organization code
- Thread-safe and suitable for multi-tenant scenarios

✅ **IOrganizationContextProvider Interface:**
- Defines contract for managing organization context
- Supports getting/setting current context
- Provides async resolution of contexts by organization code
- Includes context clearing functionality

✅ **OrganizationContextProvider Implementation:**
- Uses AsyncLocal<T> for context propagation across async operations
- Implements caching with ConcurrentDictionary for performance
- Thread-safe implementation suitable for multi-tenant scenarios
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- Additional utility methods for context management (RegisterContext, UnregisterContext, ClearCache)

✅ **Project Configuration:**
- Added System.Collections.Immutable package reference
- All code compiles successfully with no errors
- Ready for integration with existing authentication and configuration systems

The foundation for multi-tenancy support is now in place. Next step is to implement tenant resolution middleware.

## 2. Implement Tenant Resolution Middleware [done]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Develop middleware to automatically resolve and set the current tenant context for each incoming request.
### Details:
The middleware should extract tenant identifiers (e.g., from headers, tokens, or subdomains), resolve the corresponding organization, and populate OrganizationContext for downstream use.
<info added on 2025-05-27T10:19:32.058Z>
Successfully implemented tenant resolution middleware components:

✅ **ITenantResolver Interface:**
- Defines contract for resolving tenant information from various sources
- Supports resolution from HTTP requests, headers, JWT tokens, and URLs
- Provides configurable resolution order strategy

✅ **TenantResolver Implementation:**
- Multi-strategy tenant resolution (Headers → Token → URL)
- Header-based resolution with common organization header names (X-Organization-Code, X-Org-Code, etc.)
- JWT token parsing with support for common claim names (org, organization, org_code, tenant, tenant_id)
- URL-based resolution from subdomains and path segments
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Graceful fallback between strategies

✅ **TenantResolutionService:**
- Coordinates tenant resolution with context management
- Integrates ITenantResolver with IOrganizationContextProvider
- Provides ResolveAndSetContextAsync for automatic context setting
- Includes EnsureContextAsync with fallback organization support
- Context lifecycle management (get, set, clear)

✅ **Key Features Implemented:**
- Multiple resolution strategies with priority ordering
- Robust JWT token parsing with Bearer token support
- Subdomain extraction (e.g., acme.prophy.ai → acme)
- Path segment extraction (e.g., /api/v1/orgs/acme/... → acme)
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- Thread-safe implementation using AsyncLocal context propagation
- Fallback mechanisms for resilient operation

✅ **Integration Ready:**
- All components compile successfully
- Ready for integration with HTTP handlers and authentication systems
- Designed to work seamlessly with existing API client architecture

The tenant resolution middleware is now complete and ready for the next phase of multi-tenancy implementation.

## 3. Integrate AsyncLocal<T> for Tenant Context Propagation [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.2
### Description: Utilize AsyncLocal<T> to maintain and propagate tenant context across asynchronous operations within the application.
### Details:
Ensure that OrganizationContext is accessible throughout the request lifecycle, including in async/await flows, background tasks, and event handlers.

## 4. Implement Tenant Isolation for API Keys and Configurations [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.2, 16.3
### Description: Develop strategies to isolate API keys and configuration settings per tenant, preventing cross-tenant data leakage.
### Details:
Refactor API key management and configuration loading to ensure all sensitive data is scoped to the current tenant, leveraging OrganizationContext.

## 5. Integrate Multi-Tenancy with Existing Authentication and Modules [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.4
### Description: Update authentication, configuration, and module systems to be fully aware of and compatible with the new multi-tenant architecture.
### Details:
Refactor authentication flows, configuration providers, and modular components to utilize OrganizationContext and enforce tenant boundaries throughout the system.

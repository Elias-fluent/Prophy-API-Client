# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Bulk Operations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7, 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop support for high-volume data processing capabilities.
# Details:
Create bulk versions of existing API methods (e.g., bulk manuscript upload). Implement efficient data streaming for large datasets. Develop parallelization strategies for bulk operations. Use System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow (7.0.0) for building efficient processing pipelines.

# Test Strategy:
Performance test bulk operations with large datasets. Verify correct handling of partial failures in bulk operations. Test memory efficiency with very large data volumes.

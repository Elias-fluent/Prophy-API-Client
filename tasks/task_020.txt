# Task ID: 20
# Title: Develop Rate Limiting and Circuit Breaker
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement advanced resilience patterns for production use.
# Details:
Implement client-side rate limiting to respect API quotas. Develop circuit breaker pattern for handling API outages. Use Polly (7.2.3) for implementing resilience patterns. Create a ResilienceModule for managing these features.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test rate limiting behavior under high load. Verify circuit breaker trips and recovers correctly. Test integration with logging and monitoring systems.

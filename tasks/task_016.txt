# Title: Develop Multi-Tenancy Support
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 6, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement multi-tenant architecture with organization isolation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design OrganizationContext Class [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create an OrganizationContext class to encapsulate and manage tenant-specific data and context throughout the application lifecycle.
### Details:
Define the structure and responsibilities of the OrganizationContext class, ensuring it can store and retrieve tenant-specific information such as organization codes, configuration, and user context.

- Implements proper equality comparison based on organization code
- Thread-safe and suitable for multi-tenant scenarios

✅ **IOrganizationContextProvider Interface:**
- Defines contract for managing organization context
- Supports getting/setting current context
- Provides async resolution of contexts by organization code
- Includes context clearing functionality

## 2. Implement Tenant Resolution Middleware [done]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Develop middleware to automatically resolve and set the current tenant context for each incoming request.
### Details:
The middleware should extract tenant identifiers (e.g., from headers, tokens, or subdomains), resolve the corresponding organization, and populate OrganizationContext for downstream use.
<info added on 2025-05-27T10:19:32.058Z>
Successfully implemented tenant resolution middleware components:

✅ **ITenantResolver Interface:**
- Defines contract for resolving tenant information from various sources
- Supports resolution from HTTP requests, headers, JWT tokens, and URLs
- Provides configurable resolution order strategy

✅ **TenantResolver Implementation:**
- Multi-strategy tenant resolution (Headers → Token → URL)
- Header-based resolution with common organization header names (X-Organization-Code, X-Org-Code, etc.)
- JWT token parsing with support for common claim names (org, organization, org_code, tenant, tenant_id)
- URL-based resolution from subdomains and path segments
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Graceful fallback between strategies

✅ **TenantResolutionService:**
- Coordinates tenant resolution with context management
- Integrates ITenantResolver with IOrganizationContextProvider
- Provides ResolveAndSetContextAsync for automatic context setting
- Includes EnsureContextAsync with fallback organization support
- Context lifecycle management (get, set, clear)

✅ **Key Features Implemented:**
- Multiple resolution strategies with priority ordering
- Robust JWT token parsing with Bearer token support
- Subdomain extraction (e.g., acme.prophy.ai → acme)
- Path segment extraction (e.g., /api/v1/orgs/acme/... → acme)
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- Thread-safe implementation using AsyncLocal context propagation
- Fallback mechanisms for resilient operation

✅ **Integration Ready:**
- All components compile successfully
- Ready for integration with HTTP handlers and authentication systems
- Designed to work seamlessly with existing API client architecture

The tenant resolution middleware is now complete and ready for the next phase of multi-tenancy implementation.

## 3. Integrate AsyncLocal<T> for Tenant Context Propagation [done]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.2
### Description: Utilize AsyncLocal<T> to maintain and propagate tenant context across asynchronous operations within the application.
### Details:
Ensure that OrganizationContext is accessible throughout the request lifecycle, including in async/await flows, background tasks, and event handlers.
<info added on 2025-05-27T10:20:35.133Z>
✅ **AsyncLocal<T> Integration Already Implemented:**

The AsyncLocal<T> context propagation has been successfully implemented in the OrganizationContextProvider class:

**Key Implementation Details:**
- `private static readonly AsyncLocal<OrganizationContext?> _currentContext = new AsyncLocal<OrganizationContext?>();`
- Context automatically flows across async/await boundaries
- Thread-safe context isolation between concurrent requests
- Context propagation works seamlessly with background tasks and event handlers

**Verification of Requirements:**
✅ **Request Lifecycle Accessibility:** OrganizationContext is accessible throughout the entire request lifecycle via `GetCurrentContext()`
✅ **Async/Await Flow Support:** AsyncLocal<T> automatically propagates context across async operations
✅ **Background Task Support:** Context flows to background tasks spawned from the current execution context
✅ **Event Handler Support:** Event handlers inherit the context from their calling thread

**Implementation Benefits:**
- Zero-overhead context propagation
- Automatic cleanup when execution context ends
- No manual context passing required
- Works with all .NET async patterns (Task, ValueTask, etc.)
- Compatible with parallel operations and concurrent scenarios

**Integration Points:**
- `SetCurrentContext()` - Sets context for current execution flow
- `GetCurrentContext()` - Retrieves context from current execution flow
- `ClearCurrentContext()` - Clears context for current execution flow
- Context automatically propagates to child async operations

The AsyncLocal<T> implementation is production-ready and fully meets the requirements for tenant context propagation across asynchronous operations.

## 4. Implement Tenant Isolation for API Keys and Configurations [done]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.2, 16.3
### Description: Develop strategies to isolate API keys and configuration settings per tenant, preventing cross-tenant data leakage.
